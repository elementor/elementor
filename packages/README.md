## Getting Started

Getting started with packages development is fairly easy & straightforward.

### Prerequisites

- Node >= 20.0.0
- NPM >= 10.0.0

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
 git clone git@github.com:elementor/elementor-packages.git
```

2. Navigate to the root level of the cloned repository:
```bash
cd elementor-packages
```

3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

4. Once the installation is complete, you can start the watchers and run the demo app to test the packages by executing:
