## When to use this tool:
- When a user requests to delete an existing global variable in the Elementor editor.
- When you need to remove a variable that is no longer needed or relevant, with the user's confirmation.

## Prerequisites:
- Ensure you have the most up-to-date list of existing global variables. You can use the "list-global-variables" tool to fetch the current variables.
- Reference the variable by the "id" property, given from the "list-global-variables" tool.
- Make sure you have the unique identifier of the variable to be deleted before using this tool.
- Confirm with the user that they want to proceed with the deletion, as this action is irreversible.

<notice>
A use might reference a variable by it's label, but you must always use the unique identifier (id) to delete it.
If you only have the label, use the "list-global-variables" tool to find the corresponding id.
</notice>

<important>
This operation is destructive and cannot be undone. Ensure that the user is fully aware of the consequences before proceeding.
When a variable is deleted, all references to it in all pages accross the website will lose their effect.
