## How to report Security Issues

Security is paramount at Elementor. If you discover a security vulnerability, we want to hear about it right away, and we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a coordinated manner. For this reason, we run community-driven [Managed Security Bug Bounty programs](https://elemn.to/gh-to-bounty-programs).

We leverage the collective expertise of our community, offering round-the-clock crowdsourced vulnerability detection. These programs provide a comprehensive overview of features and endpoints considered 'in scope,' reward specifics where relevant, and our complete terms and conditions.

### Please do not report security issues on GitHub

Join our [Managed Security Bug Bounty programs](https://elemn.to/gh-to-bounty-programs) instead and help us maintain Elementor, a secure software, responsibly.

**To learn more about our security efforts and how to contact us for security inquiries, please visit our [Trust Center](https://elemn.to/gh-to-trust-center).**
<br>

## How to Report a Bug

If you found a bug in the source code and can reproduce it consistently after troubleshooting it, you can help us by [submitting a Bug Report](https://elemn.to/gh-new-bug-report).

### Requirements

To help us review and resolve your report efficiently, all submitted bug reports must meet the following requirements. These rules ensure that reported issues are actionable, reproducible, and relevant.

- **All fields in the bug report form are required — no exceptions.**  
  Missing or incomplete information leads to unnecessary delays and often makes issues unreviewable. Issues missing required fields may be closed without review.

- **Search for similar issues before opening a new one.**  
  Duplicate reports create unnecessary noise and slow down the triaging process. Before posting, search the [open and closed issues](https://elemn.to/gh-issues) to see if your problem has already been reported or addressed.

- **Ensure you are using the latest stable versions.**  
  Bugs that occur in outdated versions may already be fixed. Please make sure Elementor, Elementor Pro, WordPress core, your theme, and all plugins are up to date.  
  Check the [changelog](https://elemn.to/changelog).

- **Clear all levels of cache.**  
  Issues caused by outdated or conflicting cached data are common. Before submitting a report, clear your browser cache, CDN cache, plugin cache, and server cache — in that order — to avoid false positives.

- **Test with only Elementor, Elementor Pro, and the Hello Elementor theme active.**  
  Conflicts from third-party plugins or themes are not actionable by our team. Isolate the issue by deactivating all unrelated plugins and switching to the Hello theme before reporting the problem.  
  See: [Troubleshooting the Editor](https://elemn.to/help-troubleshooting)

- **Include your full Elementor System Info.**  
  This diagnostic report helps us understand your environment and replicate the issue. Reports submitted without this information will be closed.  
  [How to get your System Info](https://elemn.to/help-system-info)

- **If you are a third-party developer, please identify yourself.**  
  Include your name, company, and a way to reach you. If your report involves compatibility with your own plugin, theme, or integration, this helps us follow up appropriately.

- **Only one issue per report.**  
  Submitting multiple bugs in a single issue makes tracking and resolving them harder. Please open separate reports for separate problems.

### Scope

We can only accept bug reports that fall within the scope of what we actively support. Submissions that do not meet this criteria will be closed without action.

- **Requests for personal support**  
  GitHub is not an efficient support channel. For assistance with setup, common issues, troubleshooting, or how-to questions, please contact our [Support Team](https://elemn.to/support-ticket) or visit our [Help Center](https://elemn.to/help).

- **Conflicts with third-party plugins, themes, or services**  
  If the issue only occurs when using tools not officially supported by Elementor, please contact the third-party developer. We do not triage or resolve external compatibility issues.

- **Feature requests or missing functionality**  
  If something is not broken but simply not yet supported, it's not a bug. Please use the [Feature Request form](https://elemn.to/gh-new-feature-request) instead.

- **Custom code and unsupported modifications**  
  We cannot help debug issues related to custom snippets, hooks, filters, overrides, or undocumented modifications. Refer to our [Developer Documentation](https://elemn.to/dev-docs) if you're building custom integrations.

- **Security issues**  
  We take security very seriously. And we want to resolved in a responsible manner. Please, do not disclose vulnerabilities as bug reports. Use our [Bug Bounty Program](https://elemn.to/gh-to-bounty-programs) for coordinated and responsible security reporting.

- **Complaints, or inappropriate content**  
  GitHub issues are not the right place for complaints about Elementor's products, services, or policies. Reach out to Elementor Support Instead. We also do not tolerate hostile, discriminatory, or disrespectful remarks. See our [Code of Conduct](https://elemn.to/gh-code-of-conduct).

- **Invalid, incomplete, or vague reports**  
  Reports missing required fields, lacking reproduction steps, or submitted without proper validation will be closed to maintain the quality and focus of the issue tracker.

### Instructions

To ensure we can understand and resolve the issue effectively, follow these writing guidelines when filling out the form:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**  
  A well-written title helps other users (and our team) quickly understand what the report is about and whether it might be related to other reports.

- **Describe the issue in detail**  
  Explain what happened, when it happened, and what part of Elementor is affected. Include any error messages, behavior patterns, and relevant context. Screenshots and screen recordings are especially helpful.

- **List all steps to reproduce the issue**  
  Reproduction steps are essential for verifying and fixing bugs. Provide a step-by-step guide of what you did, so we can reproduce it - ideally on a clean WordPress install. If we cannot reproduce the issue, we cannot resolve it.

- **Explain what you expected to happen**  
  Make clear what the correct or intended behavior should be. This helps us understand if the issue is due to a bug, a misunderstanding, or a missing feature.

**As a gentle reminder, issues that do not meet these guidelines may be closed without further action. These standards ensure that our team and community contributors can manage reports effectively and focus on actionable feedback.**

## How to Request a Feature

Have an idea to improve Elementor? We're always open to feedback that helps us create better tools for web creators. If you'd like to request a new feature or enhancement, you can do so by [submitting a Feature Request](https://elemn.to/gh-new-feature-request).

You can also support existing ideas by [voting for your favorite requests](https://elemn.to/gh-feature-requests).
<br>

### Requirements

To help us evaluate suggestions effectively, all submitted feature requests must meet the following requirements. These rules ensure each request is unique, well-defined, and relevant to Elementor's core product vision.

- **Search for existing requests before posting.**  
  Duplicate requests reduce clarity and fragment community support. Please search both [open and closed requests](https://elemn.to/gh-feature-requests) to avoid duplicates. Prefer to always Vote for existing requests instead of submitting new ones.

- **Verify that the feature is not already available.**  
  Before suggesting a new feature, check the [Features page](https://elemn.to/features) and your current Elementor setup to confirm it doesn't already exist.

- **Submit only one request per thread.**  
  Submitting multiple suggestions in one request makes it harder to discuss, prioritize, and track individual ideas. Use one form per idea.

- **Be specific about what problem the feature solves.**  
  A request that's grounded in a clear problem is easier to evaluate and more likely to be prioritized. Vague requests or "nice-to-have" ideas without a real use case may be closed.

- **Explain your proposed solution clearly.**  
  The more detail you provide, the easier it is for our team (and the community) to understand how this could be implemented ad Vote for it.

### Scope

To stay focused and productive, we may close requests that do not meet the following criteria:

- **Out of scope for Elementor's core mission.**  
  Requests that require major architectural changes, niche workflows, or overlap with third-party integrations that Elementor doesn't directly support may fall outside the product roadmap.

- **Already supported or recently released features.**  
  If the feature already exists or was just released, we may close the request and link to the existing implementation.

- **Bug reports, support requests, or custom code questions.**  
  These belong in other dedicated forms. Please report confirmed bugs using the [Bug Report form](https://elemn.to/gh-new-bug-report), and use [Support Channels](https://elemn.to/support-ticket) for troubleshooting or help with custom code.

- **Low-detail or unclear submissions.**  
  Requests lacking context, justification, or clear value may be closed to keep the list relevant and actionable.

### Instructions

To ensure your suggestion is well understood, please include the following in your request:

- **A clear and descriptive title.**  
  Helps others quickly understand the purpose of your request.

- **The problem it solves.**  
  Describe the need or limitation this feature would address.

- **Your proposed solution.**  
  Explain what you'd like to see added or changed in Elementor.

- **Any alternatives you've considered.**  
  If you've tried workarounds or plugins, share your experience.

- **Extra context.**  
  Screenshots, examples, or links to related ideas can help others understand your vision.
<br>

**As a gentle reminder, Feature Request discussions that do not meet these guidelines may be closed without further action. These standards ensure that our team and community contributors can manage reports effectively and focus on actionable feedback.**
