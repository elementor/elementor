Before filing a bug report, a feature request or sending pull requests, be sure to read the contribution guidelines.

## How to use GitHub

We use GitHub exclusively for well-documented bugs, feature requests and code contributions. Communication is always done in English.

## Got a Question or Problem?

Please **DO NOT** open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on one of the proper support channels:

To receive free support for Elementor we have the following channels:
* [Elementor community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Elementors/) on Facebook
* [Elementor support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/elementor) on WordPress.org
* [Elementor help center & knowledge base](https://elementor.com/help/)

If you have purchased [Elementor Pro](https://elementor.com/pro), you are entitled for personal support, please see your purchase email for details.

*To save your and our time, we will systematically close all issues that are requests for general support.*

Thanks for your understanding.

## Security Issues

Please do not report security issues here. Instead, email them to support at elementor dot com so we can deal with them securely and quickly.

## Found a Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by [submitting a bug report](#bug-report) issue to our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/elementor/elementor/issues/new?template=Feature_request.md). Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.
