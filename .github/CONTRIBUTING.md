## How to use GitHub
We use GitHub exclusively for well-documented bugs, feature requests and code contributions. Communication is always done in English.

## Got a Question or Problem?

Please **DO NOT** open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on one of the proper support channels:

To receive free support for Elementor we have the following channels:
* [Elementor Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Elementors/) on Facebook
* [Elementor Knowledge base](https://docs.elementor.com)
* [Support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/elementor) on WordPress.org

If you have purchased [Elementor Pro](https://elementor.com/pro), you are entitled for personal support, please see your purchase email for details.

*To save your and our time, we will systematically close all issues that are requests for general support.*

Thanks for your understanding.

## Security Issues
