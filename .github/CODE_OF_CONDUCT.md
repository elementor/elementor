**The Elementor GitHub organization and its repositories are collaborative spaces for web creators, developers, enthusiasts, and users to contribute, share ideas, and help shape the future of Elementor in a positive and welcoming way.**

All participants are expected to follow this Code of Conduct — without exception.
<br>
<br>

## Our Pledge

To foster an open, inclusive, and respectful environment, we are committed to providing a harassment-free and equitable experience for everyone — regardless of skill level, ability, socioeconomic status, political belief, age, appearance, nationality, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, or religion.

This Code of Conduct outlines expectations for everyone participating in any Elementor GitHub space, as well as the consequences of violating these expectations.

**We invite all contributors to help us make this a welcoming and positive experience for everyone.**

<br>

## Guidelines

To ensure that everyone feels welcome and safe, we ask all participants to follow these guidelines:

### Be Respecful and Kind

Treat everyone with kindness and consideration. We welcome healthy discussions, but we do not tolerate disrespect, discrimination, or exclusionary behavior.

### Be Welcoming and Open-minded

Our community is open to contributors of all backgrounds and experience levels. Be patient, especially with newcomers. Value different perspectives.

### Be constructive and stay on topic  

Critique ideas, not individuals.  
Keep discussions relevant to Elementor products — political, religious, or unrelated topics are not allowed.

> _Inflammatory, offensive, or off-topic discussions may be removed without warning or explanation._

### Stay organized  

Help maintain a clean and navigable community by following these best practices:

- Follow our [Contribution Guidelines](https://elemn.to/gh-contributing).
- Use [Issues](https://elemn.to/gh-issues) only for reproducible bugs.
- Use [Feature Request discussions](https://elemn.to/gh-feature-requests) to request new features.
- Do not use GitHub for support requests or complaints — use our [official support channels](https://elemn.to/support-ticket).
- Search before opening new threads.
- Troubleshoot before reporting bugs.
- Stay on topic in all conversations.
- Do not use unrelated issues to post new bugs or feature requests.
- Avoid “+1” or “Agreed” comments — use the upvote button where available.
- Provide complete information when asked, especially when triaging or debugging.
<br>
<br>

## Expected Behavior

We expect participants to:

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Assume good intent
- Listen actively and respond constructively
- Acknowledge mistakes and learn from them
- Create a welcoming atmosphere for everyone
<br>
<br>

## Unacceptable Behavior

We do not tolerate:

- Harassment, trolling, or personal attacks
- Discrimination or exclusionary comments
- Sexualized or inappropriate language or content
- Disclosing private or personal information without consent
- Spam, off-topic content, or disruptive behavior
- Using GitHub to submit complaints about the company or staff
<br>
<br>

## Enforcement

Moderators and maintainers are responsible for upholding this Code of Conduct and may take appropriate action, including:

- Removing content
- Locking or closing threads
- Issuing warnings or temporary bans
- Enforcing permanent bans in cases of repeated or severe violations

These actions may be taken without warning or explanation, at the discretion of the moderation team.

This Code of Conduct applies across all Elementor GitHub spaces — including Issues, Discussions, Pull Requests, and Comments.
