## How to report Security Issues

Security is paramount at Elementor. If you discover a security vulnerability, we want to hear about it right away, and we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a coordinated and responsible manner. For this reason, we run community-driven [Managed Security Bug Bounty programs](https://elemn.to/gh-to-bounty-programs).

We leverage the collective expertise of our community, offering round-the-clock crowdsourced vulnerability detection. These programs provide a comprehensive overview of features and endpoints considered 'in scope,' reward specifics where relevant, and our complete terms and conditions.

### Please do not report security issues on GitHub

Join our [Managed Security Bug Bounty programs](https://elemn.to/gh-to-bounty-programs) instead and help us maintain Elementor, a secure software, responsibly.
