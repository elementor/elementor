        ## ‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE POSTING YOUR REQUEST
        ### üôè Follow these best practices to help save you time
        - üîç **Search Before Posting:** Before creating a new Feature Request, please [search for similar requests](https://github.com/orgs/elementor/discussions/categories/feature-request) to prevent creating duplicates.
        - ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **Use the Upvote Button:** Rather than posting ‚Äú+1‚Äù or ‚ÄúAgreed‚Äù on threads, use the upvote button to express your opinion.
        - ‚úíÔ∏è **Clear and concise title:** Please provide a clear and concise title that gives context to your request.
        - üí¨ **Description:** In your description, provide examples, screenshots, and screen recordings if you have them (just drag and drop in the field), and explain in detail what your request is going to solve. Describe the solution and give context. Be thorough.
        - ‚òùÔ∏è **One Request Per Thread:** If you have more than one request, please submit only **<ins>ONE REQUEST PER THREAD</ins>**, so we can properly track them and reference them without any confusion.
