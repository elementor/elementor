        ## BEFORE POSTING YOUR ISSUE

        - Please create GitHub issues only for bugs and feature requests. GitHub issues ARE NOT FOR SUPPORT!

        - If you have questions or need general support, please use:  https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/elementor

        - For help and support from the Elementor community, see: https://www.facebook.com/groups/Elementors/

        - To read more about Elementor, check out our documentation: https://elementor.com/help/

        - Developers docs are located at https://developers.elementor.com/

        ### Guidelines

        - Search this repository (top of the page) for the issue, and make sure it has not been fixed or reported before.

        - If the issue can't be recreated on other sites, it's not an Elementor bug. In that case use the support links above.

        - Make sure you are using the most updated versions of Elementor, WordPress & your theme.

        - Deactivate all of your plugins. If this solves the problem, gradually activate your plugins one by one, until you spot the problematic plugin.

        - Change your WordPress theme to [Hello theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/hello-elementor/) (or other default WordPress theme).

        - If you're requesting a new feature, explain why you'd like it to be added in [the dedicated form](https://github.com/elementor/elementor/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.yaml) and not in the bug report one.
