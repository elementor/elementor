        ### üôè Follow these best practices to help save you time
        - üîç **Search Before Posting:** Before creating a new Bug Report, please [search for similar issues](https://github.com/elementor/elementor/issues/) to prevent creating duplicates.
        - üÜï **Stay Up-to-date:** Make sure you are using the most recent and stable versions of [Elementor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/#developers), [Elementor Pro](https://elementor.com/pro/changelog/), [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/download/releases/), and your theme.
        - üî¨ **Isolate the problem:** Deactivate all of your plugins (except Elementor/Pro), and temporarily change your WordPress theme to [Hello theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/hello-elementor/). If this solves the problem, gradually activate your plugins and theme one by one, until you spot the conflicting plugin or theme.
        - üïµÔ∏è **Validate Your Issue:** If the issue can't be recreated consistently or reproduced on other sites, it's likely not an Elementor bug. In that case, use one of the support links above.
        - üß© **Contact 3rd-party Support:** If the issue happens with an Elementor add-on, extension, compatible plugin, or integrated theme, contact their support first. We do not provide support for 3rd-party software.
        - ‚úíÔ∏è **Clear and concise title:** Please provide a clear and concise title that gives context to your issue.
        - üí¨ **Description:** In your description, provide examples, screenshots, and screen recordings if you have them (just drag and drop in the field), and save time by describing in detail what happened. The more information you provide, the faster we can find a solution!
        - üë£ **Steps to replicate:** Think of it as explaining to someone over the phone how to replicate your issue. They can't see the problem, so explain it in detail in a way that we can try to replicate your issue in our own environments. Be thorough.
        - üíæ **System info:** Please include the System Info report as outlined in our [guidelines](https://github.com/elementor/elementor/issues/new?assignees=&labels=status%2Fawaiting_triage&template=bug.yml). 
          - Get your System Info from your WordPress `Dashboard` > `Elementor` > `System info` [learn how to copy it here](https://elementor.com/help/hare-my-system-info/). We can't accept issues without it.
        - ‚òùÔ∏è **One Issue Per Thread:** If you are experiencing more than one bug, submit only **<ins>ONE ISSUE PER THREAD</ins>**, so we can properly track them and reference them without any confusion.
