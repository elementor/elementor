              ### üïµÔ∏è Isolate the problem and Validate your issue
              - Deactivate all plugins _**except Elementor (and Elementor Pro)**_, and temporarily change the theme to the **[Hello Elementor theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/hello-elementor/)**.
              - Verify if your problem happens when only the Elementor (and Elementor Pro) plugins are active while also using the Hello Elementor theme.
              - If the issue can't be recreated consistently or reproduced following the steps above, it's likely **not an Elementor bug**. <br>In that case, use the **[support link](https://elemn.to/support-ticket)** at the top of this form, or **[troubleshoot your issue again](https://elemn.to/help-troubleshooting)**.
