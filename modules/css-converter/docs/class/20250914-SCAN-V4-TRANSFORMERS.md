The Elementor V4 project works with transformers (from control settings to css). Inside our CSS converter we will need the reverse logic (from css to control settings).

List all of the transformers and transformer variants inside these folders:
plugins/elementor/modules/atomic-widgets
plugins/elementor/packages/packages/core/editor-canvas

Find where the transformers are located.

List all off the converters inside our CSS converter folder.

Create a table where we list the transformers, and indicate whether the transformers and the variants have been covered inside our Class converters.
