# Future Enhancements for HTML/CSS to Widget Converter

This document tracks features and improvements identified during the PRD development that are out of scope for the MVP but should be considered for future phases.

## Input Processing

### Malformed HTML/CSS Handling
- Graceful handling of parsing errors
- Recovery strategies for invalid HTML structures
- Better error messages for malformed CSS

### Large Document Processing

- Streaming processing for large inputs
- Chunked processing for complex pages
- Memory management optimizations for large DOM trees
- Caching for frequently converted patterns
- Queuing for large conversion tasks

## Widget Mapping

### HTML Widget Fallback
- Create HTML widget fallback for unsupported elements (svg, canvas, iframe)
- Warning system for complex structures that might not convert well

### CSS Grid Support
- CSS Grid layout support (currently not supported in v4)
- Advanced layout detection and conversion

## Global Class Management

### Intelligent Merging (From HVV feedback - study docs/class)
- Automatic merging of similar global classes
- Smart naming for auto-created global classes
- Advanced conflict resolution strategies
- Intelligent usage threshold for global class creation (vs direct widget styling)
- Semantic analysis for meaningful auto-generated class names

### Responsive CSS
- Media query handling and responsive breakpoints

- CSS filters and blend modes
- Vendor prefixes handling (`-webkit-`, `-moz-`)

### CSS Variables
- Enhanced CSS variables for responsive design
- CSS custom properties with fallbacks

## User Experience

### Visual Editor
- Preview mode before conversion
