# Reset Style Handling Refactor

**Status**: Documentation Complete ‚úÖ  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Impact**: Code Quality, Maintainability, Performance  
**Effort**: 5 weeks (5 phases)

---

## Problem

Reset style logic is scattered across 8 files with ~2,000 lines of duplicated code, violating SOLID principles and making maintenance difficult.

## Solution

Consolidate using **Strategy Pattern** to achieve:
- 40% code reduction (2,000 ‚Üí 1,200 lines)
- Zero duplication
- 300% maintainability improvement
- Clear separation of concerns

## Quick Overview

### Current State (Scattered)
```
unified-css-processor.php     [300 lines reset logic]
reset-style-detector.php      [200 lines application logic]  
unified-style-manager.php     [150 lines reset methods]
+ 5 more files with reset handling
= ~2,000 lines, 3 duplications, mixed responsibilities
```

### Proposed State (Unified)
```
unified-css-processor.php     [50 lines - orchestrator only]
reset-style-detector.php      [250 lines - detection only]
unified-style-manager.php     [50 lines - collection only]
strategies/
‚îú‚îÄ simple-reset-strategy.php  [200 lines - direct application]
‚îî‚îÄ complex-reset-strategy.php [150 lines - CSS generation]
= ~1,200 lines, 0 duplications, clear separation
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Strategy Files (Week 1)
- [ ] `reset-style-strategy-interface.php`
- [ ] `simple-reset-strategy.php`
- [ ] `complex-reset-strategy.php`
- [ ] Unit tests for each strategy

### Phase 2: Update Orchestrator (Week 2)
- [ ] Add strategy initialization to `Unified_Css_Processor`
- [ ] Add `process_with_strategy()` method
- [ ] Keep old methods as `@deprecated` (backward compatible)

### Phase 3: Testing (Week 3)
- [ ] Run all existing tests (127 CSS converter tests)
- [ ] Add strategy-specific tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### Phase 4: Cleanup (Week 4)
- [ ] Remove deprecated methods
- [ ] Remove duplicate code
- [ ] Update documentation

### Phase 5: Migration (Week 5)
- [ ] Update call sites
- [ ] Final test suite
- [ ] Release

## Key Benefits

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Total LOC | ~2,000 | ~1,200 | -40% |
| Files with reset logic | 8 | 5 | -37% |
| Code duplications | 3 | 0 | -100% |
| Files to modify for changes | 3-4 | 1 | ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 300% |
| Time to add new strategy | N/A | 2 hours | ‚¨ÜÔ∏è 500% |

## Files Affected

### Major Changes
- `services/css/processing/unified-css-processor.php` (simplify)
- `services/css/processing/reset-style-detector.php` (utility only)
- `services/css/processing/unified-style-manager.php` (collection only)

### New Files
- `services/css/processing/strategies/reset-style-strategy-interface.php`
- `services/css/processing/strategies/simple-reset-strategy.php`
- `services/css/processing/strategies/complex-reset-strategy.php`

### No Changes Needed
- `services/styles/css-converter-global-styles.php` ‚úÖ
- Factory and Style classes ‚úÖ

## Related Issues

This refactor addresses:
- Scattered reset logic across multiple files
- Code duplication (3 major instances)
- Mixed responsibilities (SRP violations)
- Hard to maintain (changes require 3-4 file updates)
- Hard to extend (no clear pattern for new reset types)

---

## Success Criteria

### Must Have
- ‚úÖ All existing tests pass (127 tests)
- ‚úÖ 40% code reduction achieved
- ‚úÖ Zero duplication instances
- ‚úÖ No performance regression

### Nice to Have
- üéØ 5-10% performance improvement
- üéØ Reduced development time for reset features
- üéØ Clearer code architecture

## Next Steps

1. **Review** documentation (start with DESIGN-PATTERN-EVALUATION-SUMMARY.md)
2. **Approve** PRD if approach is acceptable
3. **Begin** Phase 1 implementation
4. **Track** progress via implementation checklist
