We don't want to see comments in our codebase.
If necessary, we can extract a codeblock to method with a selfexplantory name.

Only in expectional cases we can keep them, but we prefer not to.

Especially all comments about atomic widgets should be deleted.

List in this document all files that need to be cleaned up inside the @/css-converter folder.

### Duplicate/Legacy Files (Consider Removal)
- `convertors/css-properties/properties/margin-duplicate.php`
- `convertors/css-properties/properties/margin-duplicate2.php`

## ðŸ“‹ Comment Types to Remove

1. **Atomic Widget Comments** - All references to atomic widget compliance, implementation notes
2. **Docblocks** - Class and method documentation blocks (/** ... */)
3. **TODO Comments** - All TODO, FIXME, NOTE comments
4. **Debug Comments** - Temporary debugging comments and error_log statements
5. **Implementation Comments** - Comments explaining what the code does (replace with descriptive method names)
6. **Compliance Comments** - Comments about following standards or patterns

## ðŸŽ¯ Cleanup Strategy

1. **Start with HIGH PRIORITY files** - Focus on core services and property mappers first
2. **Extract logic to methods** - Replace comments with descriptive method names where needed
3. **Remove atomic widget references** - All atomic widget compliance comments should be deleted
4. **Clean docblocks** - Remove all /** ... */ documentation blocks
5. **Preserve only exceptional cases** - Keep comments only when absolutely necessary for business logic

**Total Files Identified: 138+ files requiring comment cleanup**
