### Failed Tests:
- compound-class-selectors.test.ts:32 - Basic compound selector
- compound-class-selectors.test.ts:73 - Multiple compound selectors
- compound-class-selectors.test.ts:114 - Class missing - compound not applied
- compound-class-selectors.test.ts:152 - Order independence - normalized class name
- compound-class-selectors.test.ts:183 - Complex compound with multiple properties
- compound-class-selectors.test.ts:217 - Compound with hyphenated class names

## Root Cause

The compound selector processor creates mappings and global classes, but they are never applied to widgets because the `css_class_modifiers` metadata is not being set in the processing context.

**Evidence Location**: `PRD-COMPOUND-SELECTORS-FIX.md`

**Key Finding**: 
- Compound processor sets `compound_mappings` in context
- HTML Class Modifier expects `css_class_modifiers` in context
- No processor bridges this gap
- Result: Compound classes created but never applied

**Fix Complexity**: Medium (3 hours estimated)

**See**: `PRD-COMPOUND-SELECTORS-FIX.md` for complete analysis and implementation plan
