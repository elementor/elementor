# BACKUP OF BROKEN CSS PROPERTIES SYSTEM

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING: DO NOT USE THIS CODE**

This backup contains the **fundamentally broken CSS properties system** that was creating fake atomic widget JSON instead of using the actual Elementor Atomic Widgets module.

## üö® **Critical Issues with This System**

### **Architectural Failure**
- **Creates pseudo-atomic JSON** that looks like atomic widget format but isn't
- **Never uses actual atomic widget prop types** for validation or structure creation
- **Results in properties appearing in JSON but not being recognized by Elementor**
- **Complete failure of visual property application**

### **Specific Problems**
1. **Box Shadow**: Uses `{"$$type": "string", "value": "..."}` instead of proper `Box_Shadow_Prop_Type`
2. **Border Radius**: Uses `{"$$type": "size", "value": {...}}` instead of proper `Border_Radius_Prop_Type`
3. **Border**: Creates complex nested structure that Elementor doesn't recognize
4. **Text Shadow**: Completely non-functional despite appearing to work in API responses

## üìÅ **Backup Contents**

### **css-properties/**
- Original broken property mappers
- Fake atomic JSON generation
- Property mapper factory and registry

### **css-properties-v2/**
- "Modernized" version that's still fundamentally broken
- Still creates fake atomic JSON
- More sophisticated but equally non-functional

### **tests-phpunit/**
- All related tests for the broken system
- Tests that validate fake atomic structures
- PHPUnit tests that pass but test the wrong thing

## üö´ **Why This System Failed**

### **Root Cause**
The system was built on the assumption that creating JSON with `$$type` and `value` properties would be sufficient for Elementor integration. This is fundamentally wrong.

### **The Real Requirement**
Elementor requires JSON structures to be created by the actual Atomic Widgets module using:
- Real atomic widget prop types
- `Widget_Builder::make()` and `Element_Builder::make()`
- Proper validation against atomic widget schemas

### **What This System Did Instead**
- Created fake atomic JSON that looks right but doesn't work
- Never integrated with actual atomic widgets
- Resulted in properties appearing in JSON but not being applied visually

## üéØ **Lessons Learned**

1. **Never assume integration works** without testing actual output
2. **Never create fake atomic structures** - always use real atomic widgets
3. **Always verify JSON is recognized by Elementor**
4. **Always test visual output** not just API responses
5. **Challenge all assumptions** about system compatibility

## üìã **Replacement System Requirements**

The new system must:
- Use actual atomic widget prop types from `/plugins/elementor/modules/atomic-widgets/prop-types/`
- Generate JSON via `Widget_Builder::make()` and `Element_Builder::make()`
- Pass atomic widget schema validation
- Result in visual property application in Elementor editor

## üö® **FINAL WARNING**

**DO NOT REUSE ANY CODE FROM THIS BACKUP**

This entire approach is architecturally flawed. The replacement system must be built from scratch using proper atomic widget integration.
