# Follow-up Questions and Future Enhancements

## Phase 1 Questions (Current Implementation)
- **CSS Variable Resolution:** Should CSS custom properties be resolved to their values before conversion, or preserved as-is for future Elementor variable integration?
- **Class Naming Conflicts:** Beyond `-clone-{timestamp}`, should we implement smarter conflict resolution (e.g., namespace prefixing)?
- **Source Mapping:** Should we track which CSS file/line each Global Class originated from for debugging?
- **Validation Strictness:** How strict should CSS property validation be? Skip invalid properties or fail entire conversion?

## Phase 2: CSS Variables â†’ Elementor Design Tokens
- **Variable Scope:** How should CSS `:root` variables map to Elementor's global design tokens?
- **Variable References:** How to handle CSS `var()` function references in converted classes?
- **Variable Types:** Should variables be typed (color, size, etc.) or remain as generic values?
- **Variable Fallbacks:** How to handle CSS `var(--color, fallback)` syntax?

## Phase 3: Widget Styling (Apply to Existing Widgets)
- **Widget Selection:** How to identify which widgets should receive converted styles?
- **Style Inheritance:** Should styles cascade to child widgets or remain isolated?
- **Style Conflicts:** How to resolve conflicts between existing widget styles and converted CSS?
- **Batch Operations:** Should the API support styling multiple widgets simultaneously?

## Phase 4: Elementor Widget Creation
- **HTML Structure:** How to convert complex HTML structures to appropriate Elementor widgets?
- **Deeply Nested Elements:** Support for arbitrary nesting levels beyond current one-level limitation?
- **Widget Type Detection:** Rules for determining optimal Elementor widget type from HTML/CSS context?
- **Content Preservation:** How to maintain semantic meaning when converting to atomic widgets?

## Performance & Scale Questions
- **Memory Limits:** What are acceptable memory usage limits for large CSS file processing?
- **Processing Time:** Should there be timeouts for CSS conversion operations?
- **Concurrent Processing:** Support for multiple simultaneous CSS conversions?
- **Cache Strategy:** What CSS parsing results should be cached and for how long?

## API Design Enhancements
- **Batch Operations:** Support for converting multiple CSS files in one request?
- **Preview Mode:** Non-destructive preview of conversion results before applying?
- **Undo/Rollback:** Mechanism to reverse CSS conversions if results are unsatisfactory?
- **Export/Import:** Export Global Classes as CSS for portability?

## Advanced CSS Features (Future)
- **CSS Preprocessors:** Support for SCSS/LESS syntax in addition to standard CSS?
- **CSS Frameworks:** Special handling for Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.?
- **CSS-in-JS:** Support for styled-components or emotion syntax?
- **CSS Modules:** How to handle CSS module naming conventions?

## Complex CSS Constructs
- **Media Queries:** How to handle responsive design in Global Classes?
- **Keyframes/Animations:** Map to Elementor animation system or preserve in HTML?
- **CSS Grid/Flexbox:** Enhanced mapping to Elementor's layout widgets?
- **CSS Functions:** Support for `calc()`, `clamp()`, `min()`, `max()` functions?

## Integration & Workflow Questions
- **Design System Integration:** How to align with existing Elementor design systems?
- **Team Collaboration:** Multi-user access patterns for Global Classes management?
- **Version Control:** Track changes to Global Classes over time?
- **Import Sources:** Support for importing from Figma, Sketch, or other design tools?

## Error Handling & Recovery
- **Partial Failures:** How to handle CSS files where only some classes can be converted?
- **Validation Errors:** User-friendly error messages for invalid CSS?
- **Recovery Strategies:** Options for fixing failed conversions?
- **Logging:** What conversion details should be logged for debugging?

## Security Considerations
- **CSS Injection:** Additional sanitization beyond standard CSS validation?
- **Resource Limits:** Protection against CSS that could consume excessive resources?
- **User Permissions:** Granular permissions for Global Classes creation/modification?
- **Audit Trail:** Track who created/modified which Global Classes?

## Developer Experience
- **CLI Tools:** Command-line interface for bulk CSS conversions?
- **IDE Integration:** Plugins for popular code editors?
- **Testing Tools:** Utilities for testing CSS conversion accuracy?
- **Documentation:** Interactive examples and conversion guides?

---

**Priority for Next Review:**
1. **CSS Variable Resolution strategy** (impacts Phase 2 planning)
2. **Memory usage patterns** with large CSS files (affects implementation approach)
3. **Global Classes naming conventions** (establishes conversion standards)
4. **Error handling granularity** (determines user experience quality)
