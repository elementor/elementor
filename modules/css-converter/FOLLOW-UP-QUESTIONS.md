# Follow-up Questions and Suggestions

- How should we handle deeply nested elements in the future? (Currently only one level supported.)
- Should the API support batch operations (multiple pages/posts in one request)?
- How should we handle media (images, SVGs) in future versions?
- What is the long-term plan for authentication and authorization?
