# Mouseover Tracking Issue - FIXED ‚úÖ

## Original Problem
I was seeing the mouseover logs but these weren't being sent to Mixpanel.

```
Mouse enter on upgrade button: {currentStep: 2, buttonClass: 'eps-app__header-btn eps-button eps-button__go-pro-btn'}
üñ±Ô∏è Mouse leave on upgrade button: {currentStep: 2, hasHovered: true, hasClicked: false, buttonClass: 'eps-app__header-btn eps-button eps-button__go-pro-btn'}
‚è∞ Scheduling delayed no-click event from mouse leave
```

This was happening in all steps but events weren't reaching Mixpanel.

## Root Causes Identified & Fixed

### 1. Step 1 Only Limitation ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: `scheduleDelayedNoClickEvent()` had hardcoded check `if ( currentStep !== 1 ) { return; }` 
**Fix**: Removed the step restriction so mouseover tracking works on all steps

### 2. No Direct Mouseover Events ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Problem**: Only console logs were generated, no actual events sent to Mixpanel
**Fix**: Added new `sendUpgradeMouseoverEvent()` method that sends immediate mouseover events

### 3. Missing Immediate Tracking ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Only delayed "no_click" events were sent after mouse leave
**Fix**: Now sends immediate mouseover events on both `mouseenter` and `mouseleave`

## Implementation Details

### New Method Added
```javascript
static sendUpgradeMouseoverEvent( currentStep, mouseAction, buttonElement ) {
    // Sends immediate mouseover events to Mixpanel with:
    // - trigger: 'upgrade_mouseover'
    // - upgrade_clicked: mouseAction ('mouseenter' or 'mouseleave')
    // - upgrade_location: button location context
}
```

### Event Flow Now
1. **Mouse Enter**: Immediate event sent to Mixpanel
2. **Mouse Leave**: Immediate event sent to Mixpanel  
3. **Delayed No-Click**: Still sent after 500ms if no click occurred

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- Mouseover events now work on ALL onboarding steps (not just step 1)
- **Step 1 (Pre-Connection)**: Events stored in localStorage and sent after user connects
- **Steps 2-4 (Post-Connection)**: Immediate events sent to Mixpanel on both mouseenter and mouseleave
- Console logs still show for debugging
- Delayed no-click events still work as before

## Storage Pattern for Step 1 ‚úÖ FIXED

### The Problem You Identified
You were absolutely right! In step 1, Mixpanel isn't activated yet because the user hasn't connected. The original fix would have lost these events.

### The Solution
- **Step 1**: Events stored in `localStorage` under `PENDING_TOP_UPGRADE_MOUSEOVER`
- **After Connection**: All stored mouseover events sent via `sendStoredMouseoverEvents()`
- **Integration**: Added to `sendAllStoredEvents()` and `sendStoredStep1EventsOnStep2()`

### Event Flow by Step
1. **Step 1 (No Mixpanel)**: 
   - Mouseover events ‚Üí localStorage
   - Console logs for debugging
   
2. **User Connects**: 
   - `sendAllStoredEvents()` called
   - All stored mouseover events sent to Mixpanel
   
3. **Steps 2-4 (Mixpanel Active)**:
   - Mouseover events ‚Üí Immediate Mixpanel dispatch
