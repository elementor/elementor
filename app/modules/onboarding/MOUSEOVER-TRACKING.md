# Mouseover Tracking Issue - CORRECTED ‚úÖ

## Original Problem
I was seeing the mouseover logs but these weren't being sent to Mixpanel.

```
Mouse enter on upgrade button: {currentStep: 2, buttonClass: 'eps-app__header-btn eps-button eps-button__go-pro-btn'}
üñ±Ô∏è Mouse leave on upgrade button: {currentStep: 2, hasHovered: true, hasClicked: false, buttonClass: 'eps-app__header-btn eps-button eps-button__go-pro-btn'}
‚è∞ Scheduling delayed no-click event from mouse leave
```

This was happening in all steps but events weren't reaching Mixpanel.

## Root Cause & Correct Fix

### The Issue ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: `scheduleDelayedNoClickEvent()` had hardcoded check `if ( currentStep !== 1 ) { return; }` 
**Fix**: Removed the step restriction so mouseover tracking works on all steps

### Incorrect First Attempt ‚ùå REVERTED
Initially added immediate mouseenter/mouseleave event tracking, but this was wrong:
- Sent separate events for `mouseenter` and `mouseleave` 
- Used wrong `upgrade_clicked` values (`"mouseenter"`, `"mouseleave"`)
- Created unnecessary duplicate events

### Correct Implementation ‚úÖ FINAL
The existing delayed no-click pattern was already correct, just needed the step restriction removed:

1. **Mouse Enter**: Log to console, set `hasHovered = true`
2. **Mouse Leave**: If hovered but not clicked, schedule delayed no-click event
3. **Delayed Event (500ms)**: Send single event with `upgrade_clicked: "no_click"`

## Current Behavior (Correct)

### Event Flow
1. **Mouse Enter**: Console log only, no immediate event
2. **Mouse Leave**: Console log + schedule delayed event if no click
3. **500ms Later**: Single event sent with:
   - `trigger: "upgrade_interaction"`
   - `upgrade_clicked: "no_click"`
   - `upgrade_location: "on_topbar"` (or appropriate location)

### Works on All Steps Now
- **Step 1**: Delayed no-click events stored in localStorage, sent after connection
- **Steps 2-4**: Delayed no-click events sent immediately to Mixpanel
- **All Steps**: Console logs show for debugging

## Sample Correct Event
```
trigger: upgrade_interaction
upgrade_clicked: no_click
upgrade_location: on_topbar
step_number: 3
step_name: pro_features
```

This matches the existing pattern and provides the hover tracking without duplicate events.
