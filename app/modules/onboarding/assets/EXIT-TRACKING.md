# Exit Tracking Issue - RESOLVED

## Problem Identified
Exit tracking logs were being lost because of a **race condition between tracking and navigation**.

### Root Cause
- `onClose()` in header.js called tracking functions synchronously
- **Immediate navigation** with `window.top.location = elementorAppConfig.admin_url` 
- Page navigation **interrupted localStorage operations** before completion
- Skip tracking worked because it used synchronous storage + fallback pattern

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Navigation Delay (header.js)
- Added 100ms `setTimeout` before navigation
- Ensures all tracking operations complete before page redirect
- Maintains user experience while fixing race condition

#### 2. Immediate Exit Tracking (onboarding-event-tracking.js)
- Added `attemptImmediateExitTracking()` method
- Uses `navigator.sendBeacon()` API when available (designed for page unload)
- Fallback to regular dispatch if sendBeacon unavailable
- Still stores event as backup in case immediate sending fails

#### 3. Enhanced Window Close Tracking
- Added separate handlers for `beforeunload`, `pagehide`, and `unload`
- Better logging to distinguish between different exit types
- More reliable detection of various exit scenarios

### Key Differences: Skip vs Exit Tracking

**Skip Tracking (Always worked):**
- Single synchronous call to `sendOnboardingSkip()`
- Immediate dispatch if possible, store if not
- No navigation race condition

**Exit Tracking (Now fixed):**
- Multiple tracking calls + immediate navigation
- Added delay + immediate attempt + storage fallback
- Uses sendBeacon API for reliable unload tracking

### Testing
- Exit tracking now captures events before navigation
- Logs should be visible in analytics
- Fallback storage ensures no events are lost
- Compatible with all exit scenarios (X button, window close, etc.)
