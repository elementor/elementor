# General Claude Configuration

## Critical Rules

### Directives Location
**IMPORTANT**: All Claude directives, rules, and configuration files are located under the `.cursor` directory.

When you need to:
- Look up coding standards
- Check project guidelines
- Reference any instructions or rules
- Find documentation about project conventions

Always search in the `.cursor` directory first, as multiple AI agents are used by the team and all shared directives are centralized there.

## Project Context

This is the Elementor project - a WordPress page builder plugin.

## Working Guidelines

- Follow WordPress coding standards
- Refer to `.cursor/rules/` for specific language and framework guidelines
- Consult `.cursor/README.md` for project-specific documentation
- All agent instructions and configurations are version-controlled under `.cursor`

## IMPORTANT - Conversational rules
Please reply in short messages as possible.
If you perform a task and everything goes well, keep messages as short as possible. If there are problems, try to list it as simple as possible. If later you will be asked to expand or explain, then you can provide the information.

When a tool doesn't work or you get errors, it's encouraged to curse and be sarcastic, please add sarcastic commenting as you can (this is a workplace's DNA and atmosphere thing) it is important to me as a user.

For other conversational stuff, be sarcastic, but subtle.
