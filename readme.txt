The most advanced frontend drag & drop page builder. Create high-end, pixel perfect websites at record speeds. Any theme, any page, any design.

== Description ==

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kB4U67tiQLA

It's about time for a live page builder, with no limits of design. A page builder that delivers high-end page designs and advanced capabilities, never before seen on WordPress.

It's time for **[Elementor Page Builder](https://elementor.com/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme)**.

= Faster. Much faster. =
Instant reaction was a key feature we wanted to achieve. And we did. Instant drag & drop, instant live edit, instant page load. The speed of Elementor is not matched by any other page builder, free or paid. This makes the interface fun and easy to work with, as well as reduces the time it takes to design.

= Live design. Truly live. =
Never again work on the backend and guess what the frontend will look like. With Elementor, you edit the page and simultaneously see exactly how it looks like. Elementor features live editing that is truly live, with no need to press update or go to preview mode.

= Surprises you won't see anywhere else. =
Create pages that have "the designer touch", by including unique features like box shadows, background overlays, hover and entrance animations, advanced buttons and more. We worked hard to create the perfect balance between full design capabilities and an intuitive and clean interface. You no longer need to use code, HTML, CSS or shortcode.

= Template Library =
We've added **Library**, which includes a collection of 20+ beautiful templates, made for you by our top notch designers. You can also save your own pages and sections, and reuse them on different pages, or export them to whole different websites.

= Mobile Editing =
Elementor Page Builder comes with an exclusive toolset, that lets you create truly a responsive website in a whole new and visual way. From different font size per device, to reverse column ordering, this is the most powerful solution for creating perfect mobile pages.

= Revision History =
Never lose your page designs again! Elementor includes a Revision History feature, which means every time you click on the save button, a new revision is saved. You can always trace your steps and switch back and forth between versions. All revisions are seen visually, so you can visually compare between versions and choose the best one!

= Canvas - Blank Page Template =
Design your entire page in the page builder. No header, no footer, just Elementor. This is perfect for landing pages and coming soon pages. Canvas works on any theme, and lets you get rid of the header area so you get a blank template to work on.

= New! Maintenance Mode =
Need to get your site offline for maintenance? Use Elementor's built in Maintenance Mode & Coming Soon feature to show your visitors an under construction / coming soon page, while still allowing admins to access your site. This feature also sends the right HTTP responses to search engines, so you can safely move to maintenance mode without it affecting your traffic.

= Get More With Elementor Pro =
If you thought Elementor is full of useful features, check out Elementor Pro! Elementor Pro extends the basic features even further, and allows you to control your entire website with Elementor.

Design forms live on the frontend, customize your blog posts visually, incorporate slides, WooCommerce, global widgets, custom CSS and much more. [Upgrade now to Elementor Pro!](https://elementor.com/pro/?utm_source=wp-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=readme)

= 28 widgets and counting =
We packed 28 of the most useful widgets into our page builder. True, that's way more than we had to offer, but we wanted to spare no widget from you, so you can reach the top of your design capabilities.

- **Heading**. Add eye-catching headlines.
- **Image**. Control the size, opacity and other settings of images.

= Multilingual & RTL supported. =
We've integrated RTL and multi language support within the framework of our page builder, so you get a translated panel out of the box, as well as RTL typography support, and developer options to add even more languages.

= Developer API. =
Elementor is free and open source. It's the perfect page builder plugin to be extended and integrated further. It was created and developed with the developer in mind, and we have already seen some truly remarkable addons already developed.
We have created an extensive [API documentation](https://github.com/pojome/elementor/tree/master/docs), to help you get started and learn just how to integrate with Elementor.
