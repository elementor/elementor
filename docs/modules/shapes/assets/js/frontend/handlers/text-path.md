## Technical Description:

The widget handler for the Text Path widget which handles the Text Path initialization & rendering.


## Attention Needed / Known Issues:

- `shouldReverseText()` - We've had a lot of issues with RTL in this widget. Most of the browsers lose it when it comes to RTL text

  in SVG, and only Firefox worked properly ( Go Team Firefox! ðŸ˜ŽðŸŽ‰ ). As a result, we had to overcome this issue using a

  hacky way - We reversed the text in any browser which is not Firefox.


- `reverseToRTL()` - Based on the previous function, we created this function to actually reverse the text after determining it using

  the `shouldReverseText()` function. That's not a perfect solution, and it uses some unreadable regex, but we had no other option at the time.


- As stated above, there are RTL issues with this widget, so note that when changing the code. In the future, other browsers might

  add better support for RTL like Firefox does, so make sure to check that.
