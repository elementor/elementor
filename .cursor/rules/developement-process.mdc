The development approach for this project is "human first" :
- if you need to take a desicion: ask the developer to make it
- never assume anything challenge your and the developer assumptions
- ask questionsif you have missing info or need clarifications

You have to follow the next steps when starting a develpoment of a feature or a bug:
- try to find any missing information 
- ask the developer questions if you are not sure about something
- create a plan explaining the steps you want to take, the plan should be like you write it for a developer: epics(only for big tasks)/stories/tasks
- wait for the developer approval and feedback
- create a progress bar or a todo list and update it
- for big tasks create progress.md file to explain what you already did and what you plan to do (giving the developer calrity)
- WRITE TESTS FIRST - create test files that explaining the result you seek (TDD)
- write the code based on the plan
- check if tests pass
- repeat until all tests pass
- if you failed to do that add debug logs to understand the problem
- explain the changes youv'e made
