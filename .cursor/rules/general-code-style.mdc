# Code Style

## Avoid Magic Numbers
- Do not use unexplained hardcoded values ("magic numbers") in code or tests.
- Define such values as named constants or use existing constants to clarify their meaning.

## Consistent Error Codes and Status
- When returning error codes and HTTP status, always be very specific to use the correct code, not only 200 and 500.

## Prioritize Style and Developer Experience
- Always pay attention for clarity, maintainability, and ease of understanding, even if the underlying logic does not change.
- Code style and developer experience are important for long-term project health.

## Self Documented Code
- Avoid adding comments that can be a constants or a well named function
- Always prefer to create small funcitons that describe themself
