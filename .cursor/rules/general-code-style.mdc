# Code Style

## Avoid Magic Numbers
- Do not use unexplained hardcoded values ("magic numbers") in code or tests.
- Define such values as named constants or use existing constants to clarify their meaning.

## Consistent Error Codes and Status
- When returning error codes and HTTP status, always be very specific to use the correct code, not only 200 and 500.

## Prioritize Style and Developer Experience
- Always pay attention for clarity, maintainability, and ease of understanding, even if the underlying logic does not change.
- Code style and developer experience are important for long-term project health.

## Self Documented Code
- Avoid adding comments that can be a constants or a well named function
- Always prefer to create small functions that describe themselves
- Only add comments to explain "why" when it is truly not understandable from the code itself
- Do NOT add comments that explain "what" the code does (the code should be self-explanatory)
- Examples of unnecessary comments to avoid:
  - `// Loop through items` (obvious from for loop)
  - `// Check if user exists` (obvious from if statement)
  - `// Return the result` (obvious from return statement)
  - JSDoc comments that just repeat the function name or parameter names
- Examples of valuable comments to keep:
  - Business logic explanations that aren't obvious from code
  - Workarounds for bugs in third-party libraries
  - Performance optimizations that might look odd without context
  - Complex algorithms where the "why" matters more than the "what"
