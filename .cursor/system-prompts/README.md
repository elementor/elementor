# System Prompts Structure

## MCP Usage Approach
**Use Playwright MCP when you need to understand app behavior!**

## File Structure:
- **`mcp-rules.md`** - MCP-specific behavior and tool usage rules
- **`agent-rules.md`** - General agent behavior and project management rules  
- **`elementor-specific.md`** - Elementor-specific testing rules

## Usage:
1. **Use MCP when needed**: For app analysis and debugging
2. **Follow Agent Rules**: Use project workflow and testing strategy
3. **Apply Elementor Rules**: Use domain-specific testing patterns

## Key Principle:
**Analyze → Understand → Act → Verify**
