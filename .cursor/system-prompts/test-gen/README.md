## Usage Context

These prompts are designed to work together for comprehensive test generation:

1. **Planning Phase**: Use `agent-rules.md` for test plan creation
2. **Implementation Phase**: Apply `elementor-specific.md` for platform details
3. **Debugging Phase**: Follow `mcp-rules.md` for interactive analysis

## Integration with Technical Rules

These system prompts work in conjunction with:
- `/.cursor/rules/tests-code-style.mdc` - Technical testing standards
- `/.cursor/rules/general-code-style.mdc` - General code quality rules
